Code for this part of the challenge is at https://github.com/Dan2552/syntax-challenge

`bin/visual_test` is supposed to output a syntax highlighted HTML file. You can put this into a file to open by running `bin/visual_test >output.html`.

The code is tested, and specs are written with rspec

There are issue(s) in the code that prevent the syntax highlighter working as expected. For a successful output you should see both the text above and below the `###` (in the outputted HTML file) with at least some colour.
